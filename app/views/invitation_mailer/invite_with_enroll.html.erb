  <p>We invite you to explore the following financing options available to our students:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><%= link_to("Sallie Mae", "https://www.salliemae.com/ctsmartloan") %></li>
    <li><%= link_to("SkillsFund", "http://turing.skills.fund/accepted") %></li>
    <li><%= link_to("Climb",      "http://www.climbcredit.com/apply/turing") %></li>
    <li><%= link_to("Meritize",   "https://www.meritize.com/") %></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  These options make it possible for you to start at Turing for as little as
  $1,000 up front and finance the rest. If you are interested in financing
  living expenses, you can do so for up to $14,000 with Sallie Mae or
  SkillsFund, up to $7000 with Meritize, and up to $3500 with Climb. For students unable to secure outside
  financing, Turing offers alternative payment plans.
  </p>
  <p>We are excited for you to join us.</p>
  <p>Congrats again!</p>
